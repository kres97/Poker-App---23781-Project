# Poker-App---23781-Project





**This repository contains partial implementation of a multiplayer poker mobile application, which
  we have created for university project, and the files contain the cloud side of the application.**
  
**The application is written for Android devices, but that's not important because we could use any other
  platform for the clients that can open websocket connection, so the server and client can communicate.**
  
**For the server side we used the following Amazon Web Services:**

   - [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/?nc2=type_a)
    
   - [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
    
   - [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/?nc2=type_a)
    
   - [Cloudwatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/?nc2=type_a)
